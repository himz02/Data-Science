# Fraud Detection
Frauds can occur in many forms such as in financial sectors, banking, government agencies, insurance, and law enforcement etc. With the advancement in technology, there are new and creative ways to commit frauds, hence the need to come up with better techniques to identify them.

In this project, several machine learning ensemble models are used to identify fradulent transactions.

Techniques such as Oversampling, Undersampling and SMOTE are applied to combat the imbalance in the dataset. 
Accuracy metric such as Precision, Recall and F-1 score are calculated for each method and compared.

Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, ydata_profiling for EDA, SMOTE, Oversampling, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Bagging and Boosting, Ensemble models with weights.
