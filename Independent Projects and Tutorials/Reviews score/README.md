#Sentiment Score Prediction
This project is aimed at identifying the sentiment of reviews posted online using a Hugging Face model.
The first step is to install transformers library current Colab notebook.
PyTorch-Transformers is a library of state-of-the-art pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This library currently contains PyTorch implementations, pre-trained model weights, usage scripts and conversion utilities for the following models: BERT (from Google) GPT (from OpenAI)
This projects predicts a sentiment score ranging from 1 to 5 depending on the text in the reviews. 
Reviews are scraped using BeautifulSoup4.
And the pre-trained model is used to make predictions

Tools used: Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Hugging Face, WordCloud, Seaborn for class visualization.
